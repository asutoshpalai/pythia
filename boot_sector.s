times 510 -( $ - $$  ) db 0 ; When compiled , our program must fit into 512 bytes ,
; with the last two bytes being the magic number ,
; so here , tell our assembly compiler to pad out our
; program with enough zero bytes (db 0) to bring us to the
; 510 th byte.
dw 0xaa55 ; Last two bytes ( one word  ) form the magic number ,
; so BIOS knows we are a boot sector.
